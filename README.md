Control System Design and Analysis
Overview
This project focuses on the design and analysis of Lead and Lag controllers to optimize the performance of control systems. The aim is to minimize overshoot and settling time for systems responding to ramp inputs. Various design methods, including pole-zero placement and graphical techniques, are employed. MATLAB and Simulink are utilized for simulations and comparisons.
